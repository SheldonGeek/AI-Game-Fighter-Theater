My first Artificial Intelligence Game! Fighter Theater! Check it out


* I found a fun AI game to learn and to build. You can watch the game from here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOvc_FPU4D8
Those heros just play games by themselves and make strategies and decisions autonomously!

* The meat of the project is the state machine. State machine has a lot of different states. It jumps to next state if it meets the condition of its previous state. Every state can have its' own action.

* For this game, every fighting hero (state machine) has 4 states - exploring, seeking, fighting, and delivering.  Exploring is the entry state for every hero. After every hero enters the game with exploring entry state, it will check conditions to decide if it wants to change to fighting with enemy, seeking energy stones or delivering stones back home state. They are smart, aren't they?

* This is how the game looks like. Enjoy!
